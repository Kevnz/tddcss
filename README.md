Media query kata
===============

This is based on the example in Chris Coyier's blog on "CSS Media Queries & Using Available Space" at http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/

there is starting markup and styles for a list of email addresses add tests and then styles for the following:

1. When the browser width is 700 to 1000px, preface the links with the text "Email: " (using CSS Content).

2. At browser window widths above 1001px, append the email address to the links.

3. Above 1151px, preface the links with "Email:" again.
